### Dear Sir,
I am Massimiliano Zonta, an automation engineer that actually is the owner of the sole proprietorship [AEX Engineering by Ing. Zonta Massimiliano  <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>][aexengineering]

If you like, below you can find some biographical notes.

### My first steps
I was born in Asiago in 1975 and grew up in Bassano del Grappa, both located in North-East of Italy, in the land of Venice Republic. These two places have always been two poles of attraction, my radix, my two dear hometowns.
Even if the distance between these two is just 30km or 45 minutes by car, almost nothing nowadays but not forty years ago, it's enough to say that I have a bicultural identity. And this has had its influence in my character and even in my job.

### Education
The idea to work in automation and make machines that can run automatically was in my mind since I was young.
<br>
I cannot say I am an automation integralist because I am curios and interested also in other fields, but it was, and it is a common thread in my education and in my professional activity.
<br>
For that reason I attended and got diploma in Industrial Engineering at I.T.I.S. "E. Fermi" in Bassano del Grappa, in 1994, and the degree in Electronic Engineering form University of Padua, in 2000. In the same year I passed the State Exam.
<br>
From July 2000 to July 2001 I performed the military service in the 7th Alpini Regiment in Feltre, where I spent time with I good friends, and from where I got some teachings both for personal and professional life.

### Work Experience
After that I moved to Alba, located in the North-West of Italy, where I worked for two years in OPM (now CM-OPM), in the food packaging business.
This was my first job and there I got the imprinting and the training about what does it mean to be an automation engineer how I am now.
<br>
There I began to use PLC, Robots (mainly SCARA) for Pick&Place guided by vision, test the machines and follow the start up.
<br>
But the fatherland called me back and so I moved back to North-East.
<br>
So, I was four years in AP2, an automation company in Vicenza, and then in Sanovo Technology Group Italia, a company nearby Vicenza that build egg processing equipments, for other seven years, until March 2015.
<br>
In both places I did almost the same jobs like testing the electrical equipments, developing PLC and HMI/SCADA software and follow the start up, but with some differences in the type of businesses and in the level of responsabilities.
<br>
In AP2 I foolowed projects of continuous line for calendering and coating while in Sanovo I had experiences in the food processing, like pasteurization, ultrafiltration, drying and in general liquid product handling.
<br>
Moreover, in Sanovo like before in OPM, I met again a company that build machine and develops inside the automation, so, aside the hardware and software jobs, I was more involved in the project of the machines and plant supplied: starting from the design of the automation configuration, passing for the management of the suppliers of the electrical equipents until the start up, training and aftersale service of the customers.
<br>
During these years, beside the different challenges I faced in the jobs, I had the chance to meet people from different countries and cultures, from East to West and North to South. Almost always I found good friends and I hope I left them a good reminder of me and of my job.

### A New Branch: the Enterprise
I decided to create a place where I could grow up my knowledges and job experiences in a more independent way.
<br>
So I left the company and I took the time for self-training to updating my knowledges in relation of high level programming.
<br>
With the begining of 2016 I opened my own company.

## About this site
This site is a collection of personal note related to my professional interests and new things I am learning.

## Post Scriptum
Because, my dear reader, you have been so patiente to read all until the end, I'd like to give you a present.
I know my long name Massimiliano can be difficult to say and can take more time than those you need to drink an Espresso, so I let you to call me like normally
my family members and other friends do, that is *Massi*, my favourite, or *Zonta*, or even *Max*. Even in case of last one I will smile you as well.
<br>

### *Sincerely*,

## *Massimiliano Zonta*
